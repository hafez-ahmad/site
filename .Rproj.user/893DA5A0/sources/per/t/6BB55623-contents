# Projects

Welcome to the Projects section! Here, you can find detailed information about various projects I have worked on. Stay tuned for updates.

# Current Projects

-   Detection and tracking of mesoscale eddies in the Bay of Bengal using Satellite altimetry data
-   Hydrologic and geospatial analyses to quantify surface-water connectivity of Lower Mississippi river and develop framework for evaluating tradeoffs between limiting invasion risks and maintaining hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes
-   Applications of Machine learning in Computational Oceanographic Research
-   Integrating Machine Learning and Remote Sensing for Long-Term Monitoring of Chl-a in Chilika Lake, India
-   Simulation of the land use/land cover and land surface temperature change in the Chittagong City Corporation using QGIS
-   Simulation of the future land use/land cover change in the Starkville, Mississippi, USA
-   Marine Spatial Planning to support Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Bangladesh

# Completed Projects

-   Future of the Irrawaddy Delta with decreasing fluvial sediment supply and SLR
-   Spatio–temporal variability of SST, SSS, and Primary productivity in the Bay of Bengal
-   A case study for the Biodiversity Assessment and land cover in the Sundarbans mangrove forest
-   Collaborative Research: The tropicalization of Western Atlantic seagrass beds (Volunteered in Dr. James Douglass's marine ecology lab)
-   Status and Future Trends of the Bangladesh Coastal Zone Management and coastal risks
-   Present status of impacts of climate change and adaptations in Bangladesh coastal areas

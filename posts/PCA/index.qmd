Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate statistical technique that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of correlated variables into a set of orthogonal, uncorrelated axes called principal components. The primary motivation behind PCA is to reduce a large number of variables into a smaller number of derived variables that may be readily visualized in 2 or 3-dimensional space. For example, PCA might be used to reduce strongly correlated data groups, evaluating aquatic habitat suitability, analysis of fish abundance, seasonal and spatial variation, and ecosystem organization change, analysis of intra and interspecific variability, niche differentiation, and partitioning.......

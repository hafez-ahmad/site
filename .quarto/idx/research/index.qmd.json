I primarily investigate parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), particulate organic carbon (POC), total suspended matter (TSM), turbidity, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and sea surface temperature (SST). By leveraging multi-source satellite data (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-3 OLCI, MODIS, VIIRS & PACE) and field observations, I develop and validate ML models—including XGBoost, random forest, and convolutional neural networks—for accurate and scalable estimation of these indicators in complex coastal and estuarine systems.\n\nA key objective of my work is to improve water quality monitoring in regions experiencing rapid environmental changes, such as the Gulf of Mexico/ AmeriCA and the Bay of Bengal. I analyze long-term trends and seasonal variability of key parameters and explore how oceanographic drivers, including wind, currents, and temperature anomalies, influence biogeochemical dynamics. I also integrate Google Earth Engine and cloud computing platforms to enhance large-scale, time-efficient analyses.\n\nHydrodynamic modeling is another cornerstone of my research. I use tools like the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) to simulate water circulation, sediment transport, and hypoxic zone formation. I combine these simulations with field data, such as ADCP measurements, to model how physical processes influence the spatial distribution of water quality parameters. My research includes examining how river discharge, bathymetry, and land use changes affect hydrological connectivity and water column mixing.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary approach, I aim to support early warning systems for harmful algal blooms, sediment resuspension events, and nutrient pollution hotspots.

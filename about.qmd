## Field Work in the Keys Marine Laboratory, Florida, USA

![Field Work in the Keys Marine Laboratory](images/dive1.jpg)

The Keys Marine Laboratory (KML) is a full-service marine field station situated in the heart of the Florida Keys. I spent three days there conducting fieldwork, lab work, and research under the supervision of Dr. Douglass. We dived into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, identifying seagrass, marine fishes, and coral reef species.

## Working in the Marine Ecology Lab

This is Dr. Douglass's Ecological Lab. I spent about 86 hours in the Fall 2019 semester working on benthic samples and sorting with four graduate students from Florida Gulf Coast University.

## Leadership Program

The Social Leadership Hackathon is a half-day workshop where students from diverse backgrounds come together to learn and exercise leadership to solve a problem in their community. Participants work in small groups to focus on a particular local problem and create an action plan to solve it.

## Atlantic Ocean

I love the ocean and its weather. I had the opportunity to dive into the Atlantic Ocean.
